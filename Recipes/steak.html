        <h3>Steak</h3>
        <p>Start by choosing a good cut of steak such as ribeye, strip, or filet mignon. Remove it from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to let it come to room temperature, which helps it cook evenly. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, then season generously on both sides with coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet over high heat until it’s nearly smoking, then add a small drizzle of neutral oil with a high smoke point, like canola or avocado oil. Carefully lay the steak in the pan and let it sear undisturbed for about 2–3 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until a golden crust forms.</p>
        <p>Reduce the heat slightly and add a few tablespoons of butter, along with smashed garlic cloves and fresh herbs such as thyme or rosemary. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak repeatedly for another 1–2 minutes, infusing it with rich flavor. Cook until the steak reaches your desired doneness (125°F for rare, 135°F for medium-rare, 145°F for medium). Transfer it to a cutting board and let it rest for 5–10 minutes so the juices redistribute. Slice against the grain and serve with the buttery pan drippings spooned on top.</p>
