    <h3>Pizza</h3>
    <p>Start by making the pizza dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture and stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</p>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, and add your favorite toppings   such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, and olives. Drizzle a little olive oil over the top and sprinkle with dried oregano and basil.</p>
    <p>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pizza!</p>
