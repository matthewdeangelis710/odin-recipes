    <h3>Salad</h3>
    <p>Begin by washing and drying all your vegetables thoroughly. Start with a base of mixed greens such as romaine, spinach, and arugula in a large salad bowl. Add in chopped cucumbers, halved cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red onions, and diced bell peppers for a colorful and crunchy texture. For added protein, consider including grilled chicken breast slices, chickpeas, or feta cheese crumbles. To enhance the flavor, you can also add olives, avocado slices, or nuts like walnuts or almonds.</p>
    <p>For the dressing, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until well combined. Drizzle the dressing over the salad just before serving to keep the greens fresh and crisp. Toss everything together gently to ensure all ingredients are evenly coated with the dressing. Serve immediately as a light meal or a side dish to your favorite entr√©e.</p>
